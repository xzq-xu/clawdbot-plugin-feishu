# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

> This project is forked from [samzong/clawdbot-plugin-feishu](https://github.com/samzong/clawdbot-plugin-feishu). Thanks to the original author for the foundation.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Auto-Reply Mode**: Bot can autonomously decide whether to respond in group chats
  - Dual-condition trigger: minimum message count AND minimum time window
  - Debounce mechanism: waits for chat to settle before evaluating
  - Agent decision: outputs `[NO_RESPONSE]` to silently skip responding
  - Configurable via `autoReply.enabled`, `minMessages`, `minTimeMs`, `debounceMs`
  - @mentions always trigger response regardless of auto-reply settings

### Fixed

- **Auto-Reply Time Condition**: When message count is met but time isn't, now correctly waits for remaining time instead of stopping

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Media Download Support**: Full support for receiving images, files, and audio from Feishu
  - Images: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP - downloaded and passed to OpenClaw for multi-modal processing
  - Files: PDF, DOC, TXT, etc. - downloaded with original filename preserved
  - Audio: Opus/Ogg voice messages - downloaded for agent processing
- **Configurable Media Directory**: New `mediaDir` config option
  - Default: System temp directory (`/tmp/openclaw-feishu-media/`)
  - Supports `~` expansion for home directory paths
- **Rich Text (Post) Message Parsing**: Proper handling of Feishu rich text messages
  - Extracts text, images, links, mentions from post content
  - First image in post is downloaded for multi-modal processing

### Changed

- **Rebranded to OpenClaw**: Updated package name and all references from Clawdbot to OpenClaw
  - Package: `@xzq-xu/feishu`
  - Removed legacy `clawdbot.plugin.json` and `moltbot.plugin.json`
- **Streaming Card Title**: Now optional - remove `title` from config for cleaner message preview

### Fixed

- **Message Resource API**: Use correct `im.messageResource.get` API for user-sent media
  - Previous `im.image.get` only worked for bot-uploaded images
- **Content Type Detection**: Improved MIME type detection from magic bytes
  - Added support for Ogg/Opus audio detection
  - Better file extension mapping

## [0.1.8] - 2025-01-30

### Changed

- **Simplified media handling**: Removed custom `![name](file://path)` format from reply-dispatcher
  - Media sending now only handled through Clawdbot's standard `outbound.sendMedia` interface
  - This aligns with Clawdbot's architecture - channel adapts to framework, not vice versa
  - Cleaner codebase, less confusion for Agent

### Fixed

- **File path resolution** (from v0.1.7): Searches multiple directories for relative paths
  - Searches: cwd, home, ~/.clawdbot, /workspaces
  - Better error messages
